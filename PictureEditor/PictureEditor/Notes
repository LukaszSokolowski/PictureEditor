vImage is an image processing library from Accelerate framework
--------------------------------------

To process an image with this library we use vImage_Buffer, also user can easly convert from CGImage to this type.
Most of UIImage have cgImage property, so there is easy way to convert into the vImage_Buffer:
let image = UIImage("image.jpg")
let imageBuffer = try? vImage_Buffer(cgImage: image.cgImage)
--------------------------------------

To convert from vImage_Buffer to UIImage we need to go through few steps:

let originalCgImage = uiImage.cgImage, //Orignal CGImage from UIImage
let format = vImage_CGImageFormat(cgImage: originalCgImage) //Create vImage_CGImageFormat based on orignal CGIMage
let cgImage = try? buffer.createCGImage(format: format)
